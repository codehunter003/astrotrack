üåç Satellite Data Registry & Telemetry Storage DApp
Overview
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages the Ethereum blockchain to store and manage satellite metadata and telemetry data. It uses smart contracts for secure and tamper-proof satellite data storage while integrating with IPFS for handling large datasets like satellite telemetry.

The frontend is developed using React and Ethers.js, providing an intuitive interface for interacting with the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

Key Features
Satellite Metadata Storage: Satellite information (ID, name, position, and timestamp) is stored on-chain in a smart contract.
IPFS Telemetry Storage: Large telemetry data is stored off-chain on IPFS, with only the IPFS hash stored on-chain to ensure immutability and verifiability.
Real-time Updates: Users can add, update, and query satellite data.
Smart Contract Events: Changes in satellite data trigger events, ensuring transparency and traceability.
Ethereum Integration: Full integration with the Ethereum network, using Ether.js for blockchain interactions.

Tech Stack
Ethereum Blockchain: Smart contracts for storing satellite data.
Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
IPFS: Decentralized file storage for telemetry data.
React: Frontend framework for UI.
Ethers.js: Ethereum JavaScript library for interacting with smart contracts.
MetaMask: Ethereum wallet for connecting to the DApp.

Project Architecture
1. Smart Contract Layer (Backend)
SatelliteRegistry.sol: Manages on-chain storage of satellite metadata (ID, name, position, and timestamp).
SatelliteDataStorage.sol: Stores the IPFS hash for telemetry data.
2. Off-Chain Storage (IPFS)
Telemetry data (e.g., JSON or CSV files) is stored on IPFS. The contract stores the corresponding IPFS hash for verifiability.
3. Frontend (React + Ethers.js)
React frontend with Ether.js for interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.
Users can update and retrieve satellite data.
MetaMask is used for connecting to the Ethereum network and signing transactions.

Flow:
Satellite metadata is stored on-chain using the SatelliteRegistry.sol contract.
Large telemetry data is uploaded to IPFS, and the IPFS hash is stored on-chain using SatelliteDataStorage.sol.
Users interact with the smart contracts via the React frontend, using MetaMask to send transactions.
